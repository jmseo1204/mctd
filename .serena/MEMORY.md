# User Preferences and Project Context

- **User Goal**: Reproduce experiments for `maze2d` and `antmaze` stitch datasets using the `mctd_repo`.
- **Key Files**:
    - `algorithms/diffusion_forcing/df_planning.py`: Contains MCTS (`p_mctd_plan`) and planning logic.
    - `algorithms/diffusion_forcing/df_base.py`: Base class for diffusion models.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Check for pre-trained models.
    2. Check for test scripts.
    3. Reproduce `maze2d` and `antmaze` experiments.
- **Constraints**: always refer to this memory before running tasks.
